## Chapter 1 : Introduction to Javascript

### 1.1 What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that makes websites more interactive. Along with HTML and CSS, it is one of the most popular languages for web development, providing additional logic and functionality.

Originally used in the browser, now JavaScript can be used outside the browser with Node.js. As a scripting language, its code does not need to be compiled and translated by an interpreter, making it possible to write programs with minimal code. For example, just one line of code can display "Hello, World!" on screen.

```
console.log("Hello World");
```
or open code 1.1-helloworld.js

### 1.2 History of Javascript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich of Netscape. It was originally called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," before finally being renamed "JavaScript" to capitalize on the popularity of the Java language, even though the two are not related.

JavaScript was later standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and is also known as ECMAScript. Well-known ECMAScript versions are:

- ECMAScript 3: Widely used between 2000-2010.
- CMAScript 5: Released in 2009 with non-controversial improvements after-  - ECMAScript 4 was discontinued.
- ECMAScript 6: Released in 2015 with significant changes, including ideas from version 4.

Since 2015, JavaScript gets minor updates every year.

- Easy to Learn: Friendly for beginners, does not require complicated software installation, just a browser.
- Large Community: Lots of support on sites like StackOverflow.
- Career Potential: JavaScript skills are sought after in the technology industry. There are many job vacancies and competitive salaries in Indonesia, with the average salary for a Front End Developer IDR 7,300,000 per month and a Back End Developer IDR 9,200,000 per month.
